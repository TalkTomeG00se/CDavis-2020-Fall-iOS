20 - Background image, UISlider with live update, updating font size and color dynamically, reset button. App crashes when tapping into the Answer field on calculator and then somewhere else. You'd want to prevent the user from altering the value of the Answer field anyway. You can turn off the selectability of the field. Great first app!
